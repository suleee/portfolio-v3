                    flows and delivering beautiful final designs. In my current and past experiences in different kind of
                    industries help me to hone a key design eye while I am able to build and design pages that are visually
                    stunning and that clients love. In addition, I could combine the aesthetic design with a Data analysis
                    to increase the visitors and amount of conversion. </p>

                    App by using Sketch, and InVision. Also, I am capable of utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to demonstrate

                    <p>Hi, my name is Jisu Lee who is a passion for design and coding. 
                        I started out my career doing Web Graphic design in the game industry. 
                        I have been making websites since 2010 and I still can't get enough of it. 
                        Along the way I found a passion for interaction design & front-end development, 
                        and I use those passions to create interfaces that solve problems. 
                        When I'm not creating beautiful solutions, I enjoy running, hiking  and loving my beautiful Vancouver

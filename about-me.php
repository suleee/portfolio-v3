                <p>I have over 5years of experience in building high quality website/app using the principle and techniques
                    of user experience. I adapt at finding user needs articulating ideas through stories and visuals task
                    flows and delivering beautiful final designs. In my current and past experiences in different kind of
                    industries help me to hone a key design eye while I am able to build and design pages that are visually
                    stunning and that clients love. In addition, I could combine the aesthetic design with a Data analysis
                    to increase the visitors and amount of conversion. </p>
                <p>I have experience in the creation of the wire-frames, mock-ups, and interactive prototypes for websites and
                    App by using Sketch, and InVision. Also, I am capable of utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to demonstrate
                    the design.
